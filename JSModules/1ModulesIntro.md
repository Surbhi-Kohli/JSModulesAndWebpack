# Modules, introduction
As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called ‚Äúmodules‚Äù. A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.

For a long time, JavaScript existed without a language-level module syntax. That wasn‚Äôt a problem, because initially scripts were small and simple, so there was no need.

But eventually scripts became more and more complex, so the community invented a variety of ways to organize code into modules, special libraries to load modules on demand.

To name some modules(for historical reasons):

### AMD ‚Äì one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the library require.js.
### CommonJS ‚Äì the module system created for Node.js server.
### UMD ‚Äì one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with AMD and CommonJS.
Now all these slowly become a part of history, but we still can find them in old scripts.

The language-level module system appeared in the standard in 2015, gradually evolved since then, and is now supported by all major browsers and in Node.js.
So we‚Äôll study the modern JavaScript modules from now on.


### Creating a Module üõëüõë
A module allows only specific variables and functions to be accessed outside it. These variables and functions have the export statement prefixed to them.

// file "module.js"
export var someVar = "Some data";

export function someFunc() {
    return " for output";
}

// this has no "export" prefixed hence cannot be used outside this module 
function someOtherFunction() {
    return 1;
}


### Using a Javascript Module inside a Module Script Tag
The import statement is used to import variables and functions exported by an module into the script that plans on using it.

Any <script> tag in HTML wanting to import a module needs have the attribute type="module".

In the below example the module that is created in the above snippet is imported using the import statement.

<script type="module">
    import {someVar, someFunc} from './module.js';

    // "Some data for output"
    console.log(someVar + someFunc());
</script>

## Core Module features

What‚Äôs different in modules, compared to ‚Äúregular‚Äù scripts?

There are core features, valid both for browser and server-side JavaScript.

#### Always ‚Äúuse strict‚Äù  
Modules always use strict, by default. E.g. assigning to an undeclared variable will give an error.
 ```
 <script type="module">
  a = 5; // error
</script>
 ```
 #### Module Scripts are Deferred By the Browser
 A script tag of type="module", whether inline or external is always deferred by the browser (regardless of the fact whether defer attribute is used or not).

Module scripts are always deferred, same effect as defer attributefor both external and inline scripts.

It is loaded in parallel by the browser, not impacting the webpage load time. 
Once loaded, it waits for the DOM to get ready, and then the script is executed.
The page suffers no performance penalty as such. In other words:

downloading external module scripts <script type="module" src="..."> doesn‚Äôt block HTML processing, they load in parallel with other resources. module scripts wait until the HTML document is fully ready (even if they are tiny and load faster than HTML), and then run. relative order of scripts is maintained: scripts that go first in the document, execute first.
#### As a side-effect, module scripts always ‚Äúsee‚Äù the fully loaded HTML-page, including HTML elements below them.
For instance:
```
<script type="module">
alert(typeof button); // object: the script can 'see' the button below
// as modules are deferred, the script runs after the whole page is loaded
</script>

//Compare to regular script below:

<script>
alert(typeof button); // button is undefined, the script can't see elements below
// regular scripts run immediately, before the rest of the page is processed
</script>

<button id="button">Button</button>
 ```
 Please note: the second script actually runs before the first! So we‚Äôll see undefined first, and then object.

That‚Äôs because modules are deferred, so we wait for the document to be processed. The regular script runs immediately, so we see its output first.

When using modules, we should be aware that the HTML page shows up as it loads, and JavaScript modules run after that, so the user may see the page before the JavaScript application is ready. Some functionality may not work yet. We should put ‚Äúloading indicators‚Äù, or otherwise ensure that the visitor won‚Äôt be confused by that.
 
 #### Module level scope
 
 Each module has its own top-level scope. In other words, top-level variables and functions from a module are not seen in other scripts.
 In the example below, two scripts are imported, and hello.js tries to use user variable declared in user.js, and fails:
 
 ```
 //users.js
 let user = "John";
  /*********************/
  
  //hello.js
  alert(user); // no such variable (each module has independent variables)
  
  /******************/
  //index.html
  <!doctype html>
  <script type="module" src="user.js"></script> 
  <script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>
  ```
Modules are expected to export what they want to be accessible from outside and import what they need.
So we should import user.js into hello.js and get the required functionality from it instead of relying on global variables.

This is the correct variant:
```
//user.js
export let user = "John";

/*********************************/

//hello.js
import {user} from './user.js';
document.body.innerHTML = user; // John

/************************/

//index.html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>
```

In the browser, independent top-level scope also exists for each <script type="module">:

```
<script type="module">
  // The variable is only visible in this module script
  let user = "John";
</script>

<script type="module">
  alert(user); // Error: user is not defined
</script>

```
If we really need to make a window-level global variable, we can explicitly assign it to window and access as
window.user. But that‚Äôs an exception requiring a good reason.
 
### Async works on inline scripts
For non-module scripts, the async attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document.

For module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well. For example, the inline script below has async, so it doesn‚Äôt wait for anything.

It performs the import (fetches ./analytics.js) and runs when ready, even if the HTML document is not finished yet, or if other scripts are still pending.

That‚Äôs good for functionality that doesn‚Äôt depend on anything, like counters, ads, document-level event listeners.
```
<!-- all dependencies are fetched (analytics.js), and the script runs -->
<!-- doesn't wait for the document or other <script> tags -->
<script async type="module">
  import {counter} from './analytics.js';

  counter.count();
</script>

```
 
#### A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported

If the same module is imported into multiple other places, its code is executed only the first time, then exports are given to all importers.

That has important consequences. Let‚Äôs look at them using examples:

First, if executing a module code brings side-effects, like showing a message, then importing it multiple times will trigger it only once ‚Äì the first time:

```
Examples are as per ESM module
// üìÅ alert.js
alert("Module is evaluated!");
/**********************************/

// Import the same module from different files

// üìÅ 1.js
import `./alert.js`; // Module is evaluated!
/********************************************/
// üìÅ 2.js
import `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)

```
In practice, top-level module code is mostly used for initialization, creation of internal data structures, and if we want something to be reusable ‚Äì export it.
Now, a more advanced example.

 
An ES module‚Äôs interface is not a single value but a set of named bindings.When you import from another module, you import the binding, not the value, 
which means an exporting module may change the value of the binding at any time, and the modules that import it will see its new value.
This is different from CommonJS where module get imported as value and dont get updated if a file makes updation in imported module.
Let‚Äôs say, a module exports an object:

```
// üìÅ admin.js
export let admin = {
  name: "John"
};
```
If this module is imported from multiple files, the module is only evaluated the first time, admin object is created, and then passed to all further importers.
All importers get exactly the one and only admin object:

```
// üìÅ 1.js
import {admin} from './admin.js';
admin.name = "Pete";

// üìÅ 2.js
import {admin} from './admin.js';
alert(admin.name); // Pete

// Both 1.js and 2.js imported the same object
// Changes made in 1.js are visible in 2.js
```

So, let‚Äôs reiterate ‚Äì the module is executed only once. Exports are generated, and then they are shared between importers, 
so if something changes the admin object, other modules will see that.

Such behavior allows us to configure modules on first import. We can setup its properties once, and then in further imports it‚Äôs ready.

For instance, the admin.js module may provide certain functionality, but expect the credentials to come into the admin object from outside:

```
// üìÅ admin.js
export let admin = { };

export function sayHi() {
  alert(`Ready to serve, ${admin.name}!`);
}

```
In init.js, the first script of our app, we set admin.name. Then everyone will see it, including calls made from inside admin.js itself:

```
// üìÅ init.js
import {admin} from './admin.js';
admin.name = "Pete";

```
Another module can also see admin.name:

```
// üìÅ other.js
import {admin, sayHi} from './admin.js';

alert(admin.name); // Pete

sayHi(); // Ready to serve, Pete!
```
#### import.meta
The object import.meta contains the information about the current module.
Its content depends on the environment. In the browser, it contains the url of the script, or a current webpage url if inside HTML:
```
<script type="module">
  alert(import.meta.url); // script url (url of the html page for an inline script)
</script>
```

#### In a module, ‚Äúthis‚Äù is undefined

That‚Äôs kind of a minor feature, but for completeness we should mention it.

In a module, top-level this is undefined.

```
<script>
  alert(this); // window
</script>

<script type="module">
  alert(this); // undefined
</script>

```

Compare it to non-module scripts, where this is a global object:
