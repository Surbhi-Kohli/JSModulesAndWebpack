Info About this commit:
Starting off with basic html with script tag
Script is present in the end of body, otherwise html parsing gets stopped.We have not used async or defer
ES5 js is used considering era of early 2000s where browsers dont support es6

Having js in html within script tag is fine, but it will be a problem .It is not scalable to put all ur code within script tag
