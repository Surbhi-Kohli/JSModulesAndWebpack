Here we are natively using esm ,without use of any bundlers/loaders.See the network tab, Each module, starting from the entry module is fetched over the network.
It's completely unusable past 10 modules.Or even that takes forever.When you think about it,when you're using that syntax, the browser has to basically read top down.It needs to start at import statement.It needs to look at that specifier, where that package is.It needs to go resolve it(Fetch it, see its imports).It needs to then figure out all those exports actually there valid? Then it needs to read that file and do the exact same thing until it finds everyother module that it's referencing at run time, when you load your page. using ESM natively for the browser is not an option I would ever recommend to anyone,under any scenario
