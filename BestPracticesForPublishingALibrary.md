## Tree Shaking ðŸŒ³
*Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the context of JavaScript for dead-code elimination. It relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax, 
that is, import and export. The name and concept have been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler rollup.
*Webpack and Rollup both support Tree Shaking, meaning we need to keep certain things in mind so that our code is tree shakeable.
